Patterns Pandemics and Responses.

You know how a song gets stuck in your head and you can't get it out?  
The harder your try the more infuriating it becomes.  
This incessant sound repeating over and over.

Like being in a heat wave - the more you freak out the more it hurts.  

I've been trying to understand another type of undiagnosable .. cognitive tinnitus ..

these elements appearing temporally .. a pattern that feels like a network.

rubbernecking all the birds I pass.
Drawing in the obsessive stares of children who draw closer with each glance.
And more humorously, being chased down by a squirrel.

Vibrations. The sound from your high school science fair project used to accelerate your plants growth.
The same sound used to accelerate bacteria growth, now used to treat symptoms of pandemic curators.
Like swinging a towel to catch a bat with a trickery of sonar.
waving a wound wand to influence plague.

Leaving behind pound signs, posted, indicators of a hot swap; natures perceived random erasure..

ltd, stp, PTSD, stp and rolling up what you got in hopes of being treated to something else.
