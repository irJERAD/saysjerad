## We are not incentivizing the right parts of the mind

***Punishment deters the conscious mind; yet misbehavior abounds.***  
Our biggest example exists in our penitentiary system. Far from an applaudable rehabilitation system, the threat of prison is enough to keep our conscious mind from a primative life of *lie, cheat, steal* in the advancement of self.  


## The system is broken  

An overcrowded system and high incarceration rates indicate we revist the incentives schemes; rather than increasing perhaps we should redirect. The failure of manditory minimum and reincarceration rates imply that an increase in the disincentive system does not work.  


### What does the subconscious mind experience  

A consciously felt threat is the sense of preditory fear that radiates into the drivers around a police car on any given highway. Consider what the subconscious mind feels and experiences by empathizing with the situation. After the initial shock of fear expressed in the conscious mind, reactionary subconscious reactions are experienced. When the fear subsides it is normal to feel a sense of frustration, even anger at the situation. You may have thoughts such as:  
*"This [feeling] is stupid."*  
*"They [police and highway officers] are supposed to **serve** and protect"*  

Anger, targetted frustration, and criticism are normal responses to subsiding fear; however, they are poor disincentives of misbehavior. Resentment and passive aggressive attitudes are the concequences of longterm and repetitive exposure to these negatives emotions associated with the enforcers of our legal and penitentiary system.  


#### What does the fox say?  

We can look to domesticated animals for insights into the subconscious mind's behavior in the context of resentment, passive aggression and an unhealthy mix of fear, anger, and frustration in figures of authority.  
Modern pets have been bread for handling. Their mind's naturally crave attention, affection, and warm hearted touch. Their short attetion spans gives them a limited sense of awareness much like human infants and small children - they are unaware of a world outside of their existance.  

Frequent mistreatment, abuse, and neglect build up episodes of a similar anger and frustration in pets that reach the subconscious mind at some point and change the animals behavior. They start to act-out and become aggressive in what appears to be intentional behavior. Like many children with anger problems, however, they are consequences of their environment and in many parts unhappy slaves to a subconscious process that may pedgionhole them into a misbehaved expression of anger.  


### The subconscious case  

From the perspective of the subconscious mind it would appear many in the penitentiary systems population are behaving in a natural and predictable manner. The incarceration on behave of this behavior only stems to inflict another blow to the wound that bleeds acting-out and misbehavior.  


## Conclusion

When the intimidation or preditory fear that comes naturally in the presence of a legal enforcer such as drivers within visual distance of an officer's vehicle, or what is reported by minorities or singled-out individuals should be assessed from the perspective of an incentive system that takes the subconscious mind into account.  
Each encounter serves to embedded more and more likelyhood misbehavior and acting-out will emerge as a response to the recurrent subconscious stress.
