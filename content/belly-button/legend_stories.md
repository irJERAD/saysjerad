And Story Time:  

Stories are integral to the socio-cultural ebb and flow.  

As a society we experience and share our stories.  

Like the loops of fire that light our inevitable obstacles, we too must pass through stories on our journey.

On each journey, achetypal selves breakdown to pursue a path to enlightenment.  
Selves change shapes and wear masks.  
We feel context as we endure reality to the experation of each path.  

It started quietly.  
I could hardly hear whispers from a couple kids in the air vents.  

It soon began a snooty game of harassment.  

Their main focus was on my wife's safety and psuedo permiscuous life.  

In the first few months I was running around long beach in search of the horrific stories I heard about stephanie, trying to safe her from the clutches of her would be assaulter.  

Then something changed. All of the sudden there was a change of mood.  

Two very special personas arrived and the rest were gone.  

They would shower be with sparklying mist that sounded like the chink of chandelier crystal.  

They had loved me nearly my entire life.  

They shared stories of me from their perspective that started when I was 4 years old.  

"We loved you so much." 
"We watched you as a child." 
"When you came to your grandmothers for a second round of chicken pocks, we would watch over you with care."  

We had a very special connection the three of us. We could finish each others sentances:  
"sandwitches" was the word we would use.  

They told me something important was happening.  

My wife and I were going to have a very special child.  

Up to that point I had never really been interested in children. I even considered not having them ever.  

Just like this new world, however, something was changing. I could feel in myself a new set of possible futures.  

For the first time in my life I wanted to set aside my personal quest to participate in something larger than me, something that could use me to assume itself at an appropriate future date.  

These magical tooth fairies I would lovingly call them, would inspire me to take on a more selfish path.  

I would do "the most selfish thing" someone could do as my friend would say.
