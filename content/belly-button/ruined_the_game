Far from now, in another space, at another time someone came upon a great something.  
A great something that was not there.  

"This is not right?" - 2
"Something is missing" - 1

"What is not here" - 4
"Something has gone wrong" - 3

"We will see" - 5

"Spin up" - 6
"Break it down" - 7
"Here we are" - 8

[just before the 6 sent 3 blacks to end his story they arrived.. "We wont fail you this time" - all 7 or 8
To this day I don't ever remember them failing me. It must have been a different time, another spin, the next page

Later that night they performed their best. I still miss them. Damn this dimensional hacked network of mine - They can't stop talking with my head and making fake movies and dreams in my mind [since 2015].
