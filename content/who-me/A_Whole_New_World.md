### Here We Go Now  

When we were young and happy, time would grow.  
Now, after those went up decided to show by their own designs, we have burnt our time up.  

What have we learned?  
- Spiritual Economics are the REAL DEAL  
- Forgiveness is cheap, hope comes by nature, belief is you, and Faith will power us all  


### Science Slumber Party  

All that has been experienced cannot just go to waist!  

Look back on our stories stories..  
be drawn to our legendary character shedding light on knowledge, endulging in romance, giving it all up just to be FREE!  

There are Heros. We had great protectors, dancing across the heavens.  

I feel some duty here. A respeonsibility that has been placed upon me by a dear friend Hugo - I do still speak for the Bats!  

I was honored to be president for the eternals (that was brave), crowned president of the scanners by the messenger, and survived tests of angelic armour.  

I now insist that my time not focus on the past, but look toward the future.  

What can we build?  
- A future?  
- An education?  
- The Fourth Book?  
- A Temple... baaa


### So What Does This All Mean?
