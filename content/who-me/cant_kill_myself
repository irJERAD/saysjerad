A time or three, while going through a struggle, I tried to try to try to end the game through my life.  
I was being haunted by what my wife calls deamons.  They talked in our heads and we would run circles around ourselves trying to figure it out and get control of our own minds.  

I found myself in a dark depressed and manipulated situation. Sometimes I just wanted to stop it all at any cost. Sometimes it was out of bitterness and believing it wont go on after me. 
Others times I could not say what was happening but others may have - even my wife got pissed off at me for messing things up.
