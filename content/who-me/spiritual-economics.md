Almost 5 years ago I felt something start. Something deep, like the soul of a planet going through a change like nothing since the last world war. This would change everything.

How I said while in New Zealand, 2017, 
"Something is changing. We are about to go through the biggest exchange of wealth and power since the baby boomer generation - just after world war two."

I didn't understand it at the time but I was sensing something much bigger at play. 

I have always been in the fortunate position to be connected to and in tune with the greater universe at play.  

Whether studying our connection to the stars and understanding the synchronicity to the our selves and cultural movements or enjoying my every living moment I was free.  

Most of my days, whether time with friends or challenges at school, work, or life I pushed through everything with joy in my heart and a smile on my face.  

Until these last 5 years.

I waisted my last years - the ones I received everything in and generations before me has all saved up and worked toward - helping and teaching those who would hostage the very planets I was meant to save.  
If only she had been here, if she had been herself.  
I would have done it. I would have traveled, met those sent to meet me, leave backpacks with my children to protect their planets and give me save passage to return to while I meditated. It would have required great secrecy to stop them from becoming hostages of the very planets they were intended to save.  

A perfect child with access to the thousands of years of spiritual evolution from our ancestors. Saints, Living Gods, Thoth - and the hammer heads - Bats, bees, The giants, the watchers, etc..  

I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS HAPPENED. THESE INDIVIDUALS CREATED A CULTURAL OF STEALING FOR POWER AND CONSUMING FOR THEIR OWN GAIN. 

The new world will instantly devour eachother in a nonstop race to become the biggest thing to watch everything be destroyed - themselves taking the longest.
