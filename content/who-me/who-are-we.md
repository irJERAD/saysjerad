It all started in 2009, or so I believed..

I had just moved to San Diego from Los Angeles. My new rooms mates were super cool and I was really looking forward to hanging out more with them as this new life was about to begin. 

About two weeks before I started classes at UCSD as a Cognitive Science major - which I was super excited for - I met a girl.
