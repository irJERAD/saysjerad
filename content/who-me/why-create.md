## Introducing the unessential  

The unnecessary has an interesting place in our lives. Surely we are gluttunous creatures with plenty of excess. Among the hoggish slop of redundance and the encumbering wealth of consumerism is a very specific form of unessential I am calling out here.  

A very refined excess that is cultured by nature; culture, in-fact, is so bound with it, it is defined by and along-with this most uneeded of creations. I am carving here a place to examine music, and more broadly, artist production and why it is we endeavor so tirelessly to create and spend so frivolously to consume. All to validate the importance of something so not needed, by you or anyone for that matter.  


## Discovery of the trivial reveals vast subtlety  

I can toil for hours over days to work out a musical phrase to be just so. Just so I feel this phrase has actualized. Become itself, ready to take off on its own. Musical creation is a process of discovery for me. I can relate to the paleontologist just as much the scultor when writing my own music.

I have no stadium of academia to broadcast discovery.  
No fountain or fair to display my efforts yield.  
In each I learn, lost in ignorance.  
In any I build, sacrificed to subtle revision.  


The significance of an object for which we have no need.  
A subject which is all things, construed, about;  
one thing, culture, self ensued genius.  
And no thing, merely ephemeral cascades of pressure.  
In-between eternal stalls of static uniqueness.  


## thoughts for spare change  

So eager and ready are we to define ourselves our times our lives by music. Music which lends itself impervious to definition or omnipotent structure. Music is not one thing or another; it is not one form or style or another; it encompasses all, each round with enough room for explorers to wonder, acheologists to unravel, and sculptors to praise.

So why is it that I take part in the non-sense that is creating more of something we don't need for no one to consume? I do it in order to take upon myself its shapeless form, timeless age, and infinite permutations and practice godliness as I build with the physical, in time, a causal instance of a reality.
