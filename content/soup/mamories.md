In the C programming language there is the concept of a space for memory seperate from the actual contents of the memory, as well as an address for that memory (known as a pointer).  

In this static / deterministic environment memory management contains these two entities aside from the contents: an address and the space itself.

What about the bitcoin block chain?
What happens when the ledger is too full to fit the transactional data?
What happens when the computation gets so fast you can finish computing the block two ways, have two solutions for the same block?
maybe: you now have twice as many units that are half their dimensional size.  

When discussing forgery sensitive items this becomes difficult to deal with.
