I went for a phenominal walk this morning.  

Started with a new encounter. 

There I shared his tats:
- sanskrit: "trust in god", "hope in man"
- suicidal king
- ace
- sun god
- death monkey

On the walk I found a very different place in my backyard.  

This tree looked like it was from a different time. Its trunk was similar to the redwoods in San Francisco with leaves like a fern. There was another fruit bearing plant that appeared to be grafted to it. It bore a fruit that had a seed like a wallnut.  

This fuzzy dandilion stuff was all over the place. The tree was covered in it and so was a lot of the surrounding area.  
It was write near where the powerful being I saw the other night were. Where it was glowing as I drove by.  
It would appear as though that small fuzzy stuff was used to send things back and forth. Similar to the Morgellons thread stuff that was happening to us in San Francisco - that we thought was mold.
