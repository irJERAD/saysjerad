## Show them how much you care  

There is no sentiment analysis or crib notes for your inner-narrative. However lovely your thoughts and sentiment are of a person, they remain entirely yours. Sure, you can share your feelings. Concede this affection over a bottle of wine then the next day and thereafter, just like the wine, they may remember your words but they will not be sitting back enjoying their fruit.  

Emotive thrives in motion and the moment, constantly needing to run free and express itself. Care for another should be no different. So what you have love for them, you already said, "I love you." Participate in their day and see what more you receive from life when occupying your time with those who already occupy your mind. This is not a one-sided request. It is a two-way reception.  

Perhaps love is so resiliant because of the reciprocity in its gifting. The greatest thing you can give true love is your true self. The most valuable asset of the self is its time. Invest your time with those you love and you will receive the greatest tressures of life; the poppy of sentiment; bliss and emotional contentment.
