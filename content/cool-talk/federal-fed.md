### *What if the Fed printed money and distributed it through stimulus packages to citzens..*  

Fed currently prints money and to inject it into the economy it provides cheap loans. This money reaches the people by lowering mortgage rates. The money reaches companies similarly through reduced loan rates.  

instead money could reach citzens directly and reach companies via consumer spending and investments that would theoretically be increased from the printed stimulus.  


### What makes people good distriubtors of wealth?  

When income increases so does consumer spending and investments. Even more so when the consumers are comfortable with the perceived financial safety accompanied by an increase of income.  

The low income college student, young professional or apprentice trades person expressed a change in spending and investment that is very healthy to the economy. An increase of income correlates to a higher ratio of investment when the individual can afford a home over rent. Beyond covering basic needs of health, shelter, and food, increases of income see a higher ratio of consumer spending.  

A working individual at the lower end of comfort affords a basic living food, rent, utilities, and health with a minor excess income to spend on future saving and investment, fashion, personal computing devices and other consumer items. The minor excess income associated with a strong consumer economy such as our own will more than double when income of a lower end comfort individual doubles.  

Example:  
*say a basic median income provides the individual 15 monetary units. Give 2 for food, 4 for rent, 2 for utilities and 2 for health covers essential needs with an excess of 5 units. A possible use for the excess could be 1 for electronics, 1 for fashion, 1 for savings and 1 for investment with 1 left as a motion piece to spend as extra food, health, electronics, fashion as needed.*  
*An inflationary policy could use a stimulus system to place an extra 5 monetary units in each individuals hands - not just the median income. You would expect essential needs expenditures to remain the same other than a possibility of increasing food by half a point. 4 units could double median income spending on electronics, fashion, savings and investments. Finally, inflation in rent and essential expenditures would be met with the final half of a point.*  

In the above example the inflationary policy results in an 100% increase in spending on electronics and fashion as well as 100% increases in savings and investment funds. Meanwhile, extra income was set aside for the inflationary policies effect on rent and essential costs. All of this resulted from an increase of income by one-third in a simulated median income.  


## Inflation goes up, so does happiness and wealth  

It should be expected that all spending from individuals who already earn above an essential needs living amount would pass their inflationary stimulus down in a manner than was better for a consumer market. Spending more - absolutely and proportionately - on what is wanted over what is needed should be marked with an increase in consumer happiness. The increased sales and profits in the consumer market from the consequence of more nonessential spending - like an increased spending on computers and fashion - brings more economic success to popular consumer brands increasing consumer confidence. An auxilerary benefit of the increased economic success in the case of electronics and small or young businesses may be an increase in affordability. Thus making the increase in spending power actually more resourceful to the consumers contentment dispite the inflationary effects on monetary value.  

Looking ahead we see an increase in the individuals financial success and happiness as both investments in savings and assets increased at a higher rate than essential items and just as high as consumer - ratio of increase in consumer spending versus investments would differ on class and case basis; however, both increase more than essential needs spending. The invitation of expenses such as a home purchases, high cost high yield investments and bulk decreased cost investments would imply that higher income gaps would see an even greater effect from this. A similar effect is already the case with inflationary policy reduced rates decreasing mortgages, small business loans and corporate bond loans aiding wealthier home owners, bank owners, and business owners - This also works to hurt savings and investments of lower income brackets who cannot afford to participate in the high financial systems (return rates on savings accounts decrease, bond returns to pension and 401k funds decrease, and money market account returns decrease).  


## Inflation goes up equally with essentials  

An inflationary market means less value or power seen per monetary unit. This effect would have a predictable effect on essential spending such as rent, food, utilities and health. Tracking the inflationary rate would cover their cost increase or relative income decrease. 5-percent monetary inflaction sees a 5-percent increase in essential costs and the effect in negated.  


## Federalize the Fed  

Currently the Fed is supported by the paying back of loans made with their money - printed freshly or previously. Using a stimulus program instead of a loan the Fed would do better as a government organization. This would provide access to federal funds as needed in place of printed inflationary capital.  


## Finalize the offer  

This system rewards the individual for a strong currency and market. It places the power to offset the effects of inflationary monetary policies. Non essential consumer spending and investment are set up to gain most from inflationary markets as explained above. The inflated amount is placed in the hands of the individual then distributed in a manner that results in an increase in financial security of the individual via an exponential increase in asset and home equity investment spending. Similarly, a linear inflationary stimulus plan should expect an exponential increase in consumer market health.  

Conversly, recurrent and essential expenditures would at most experience the linear increased stress of monetary inflation in the economy as a whole. As money goes down in value 5-percent, rent, food, even health costs increase 5-percent to offset their relative monetary experience.  

Here we have demonstrated a 1-to-1 effect on essential expenses and an exponential effect such as double or even more when reduced costs and consumer sentiment return value to the market leaders. All while increasing the consumer happiness of the individual - which is important in a capitalist society (happy people are more productive, do more, and spend more after all - increasing financial security through increasing participation rates of income gaps in financially smart activities such as home purchasing over leasing, and increasing financial success through increased savings and an increase in return from savings and money market accounts.
