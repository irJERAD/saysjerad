      <description>What if the Fed printed money and distributed it through stimulus packages to citzens.. Fed currently prints money and to inject it into the economy it provides cheap loans. This money reaches the people by lowering mortgage rates. The money reaches companies similarly through reduced loan rates.
instead money could reach citzens directly and reach companies via consumer spending and investments that would theoretically be increased from the printed stimulus.</description>
