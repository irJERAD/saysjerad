      <description>Show them how much you care There is no sentiment analysis or crib notes for your inner-narrative. How ever lovely your thoughts and sentiment are of a person, they remain entirely yours. Sure, you can share your feelings. Concede this affection over a bottle of wine. The next day and thereafter, just like the wine, they may remember your words but they will not be sitting back enjoying their fruit.</description>
