      <description>What if the Fed printed money and distributed it through stimulus packages to citzens.. Fed currently prints money and to inject it into the economy it provides cheap loans. This money reaches the people by lowering mortgage rates. The money reaches companies similarly through reduced loan rates.
instead money could reach citzens directly and reach companies via consumer spending and investments that would theoretically be increased from the printed stimulus.</description>

      <description>We are not incentivizing the right parts of the mind Punishment deters the conscious mind; yet misbehavior abounds.
Our biggest example exists in our penitentiary system. Far from an applaudable rehabilitation system, the threat of prison is enough to keep our conscious mind from a primative life of lie, cheat, steal in the advancement of self.
The system is broken An overcrowded system and high incarceration rates indicate we revist the incentives schemes; rather than increasing perhaps we should redirect.</description>
